* Program

#### [HelloWorld](./Phase1-HelloWorld)

This is a simple program that prints "Hello, World." with instructions of how to run/compile a GoLang program.

#### [Paradigm](./Phase2-Paradigm)

This document discusses what is the paradigm of GoLang with examples to illustrate the points.

#### [Plan](./Phase3-Plan)

A brief introduction of what is suitable for GoLang and what will be done for the Phase 4.

#### [Program](./Phase4-Program)

A quick view searching website specifically targeted on scraping information from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
